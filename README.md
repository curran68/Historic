# Introduction

## Why i chose this topic

We have visited York many times for a few reason, My daughter went to university of York residing at Halifax college throughout this time she had some part time jobs. This gave us an opportunity 
To wander and explore further whether it be attractions, restaurants cafes etc and of course the shops.
Having stayed at various places and visited many places, we feel York is indeed an exceptional pleace to visit.

I have designed this website to showcase some visitor attractions for the historic city of York, whether it be new visitors or returning visitors.
There are details of interesting things to visit, i have included a map to aid routes and places, within this directions are available whether it be walking, driving etc.
Also there is a simple fun quiz.
Keeping the layout uniformed and modern i have kept to simple colour schemes and what i would call a unique font trying to achieve a medieval feel.
